# Implementation-of-Fuzzy-Logic-Controller-to-DC-DC-Converters
=> Fuzzy Logic Controller for Second Order DC-DC Converters: A Comprehensive Analysis
## DC-DC Converters 

1) Buck Converter 
2) Boost Converter 
3) Buck-Boost Converter

=> Fuzzy Logic Controller(FLC) implemented in DC-DC converters using the rule base(refer "fuzzy.fis" file) consisting of "25 rules" to get the desired output("Reference Voltage") for all the three DC-DC converters.

=> For indepth understanding refer the report(REPORT.pdf) attached.
